php artisan make:model Model/Quesntion -mfr  
// this will create model in models folder, resource controller, factory, and migration

After creating the database factories we need to call it in the database seeder in an order such that
what we need to exist first are place above what will exist later.

When you get error after running db:seed. Remember to always migrate:fresh your database to start from a clean state
